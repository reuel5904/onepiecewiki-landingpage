## Why was this project made?
This website is fanmade and intended to be a remake of the Official One Piece Wiki. The project's goal was to turn a character landing page into a more "modern" and simplistic style. I have no affiliation with the One Piece Wiki and their respective community. This was simply just a fun project to work on to test out my skills.

Concepts I used when making the project:
- Modern/Simplistic take to a One Piece Wiki character page
- Animations when loaidng up the page
- Responsive Website
- Experimented with :hover techniques

## Running the project

Simply `git clone` the website into a folder and launch index.html
